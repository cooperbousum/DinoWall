### DinoWall
DinoWall is a utility for setting wallpapers according to the time of day. It is meant for 24-hour timelapses, from sunrise to sunrise. It runs on all wl-roots compositors due to its reliance on hyprpaper for setting the wallpaper. 

## Dependencies
- `hyprpaper`: Wallpaper setting
- `jq`: for json parsing of persistent variables
